<h1 align="center"> ✨ 1 time use-bot to get the Active Devloper Badge ✨ </h1>

###### <ins>**this is the new version. The old code no longer works**</ins>

<br>

### 1. Introduce
- Discord has launched a brand-new badge called [Active Developer Badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
- Used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges before, so I decided to share it. I really don't mind because this is super easy to make and everybody can make basic bot and get the badge, so just take it if you wanna. 

<br>

### 2. Localhosting / Guides

###### Step 1:
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Git](https://git-scm.com), any IDE or basically using a terminal.
- Clone this project:
  ```ruby
  $ git clone https://github.com/nnbaocuong99/ADBadge-bot.git
  ```

###### Step 2: 
- Navigate [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and login
- Click `New appplication` and fill the information, switch to `Bot` tab and `Add Bot`
- Click `Copy` or `Reset Token` to get your bot token. <sup>You just can view your token for 1 time and it will no longer reveal, for more check [this](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6470840524311-Why-can-t-I-copy-my-bot-s-token-)</sup>

      <br>
  </div>

###### Step 3
- Run this command in the directory to install the dependencies:
  ```ruby
  $ npm install | npm i
  ```
- Replace the `your-bot-token` with your bot token and run this command:
  ```ruby
  $ npm run your-bot-token
  ```
- When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL. Use it to invite the bot to your server

      <br>
      <br>
  </div>

###### Step 4
