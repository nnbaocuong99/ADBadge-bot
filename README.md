## ✨As you know / Summary
- Discord has launched a brand-new badge called [Active Developer Badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
- Used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges before, so i decided to share it. i really dont mind because this is super easy to make and everybody can make basic bot and get the badge, so just take it if you wanna. i dont have any license or tried to claim or steal from anyone.


## ✨Before we get started
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) (Optional)
- Clone this project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nnbaocuong99/ADBadge-bot.git
```


## ✨Usage / Locahosting / Guides
### 1. Do the following steps below to get your free badge

- *Create an appplication* and *add a bot* on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Click `Copy` or `Reset Token` to get your bot token.
> You just can view your token for 1 time and it will no longer reveal, so make sure you're copied and storaged it, for more check [this](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6470840524311-Why-can-t-I-copy-my-bot-s-token-)
- Use your `IDE` or `Terminal` and cd into the directory, then run this command to install the dependencies:
```
$ npm install | npm i
```
- When the dependencies succesfully installed, replace the `your-bot-token` with your real token and run this command:
> If it not working, try `npm run run`
```
$ npm run your-bot-token
```
- The bot will auto generate a link for you like the pic below, use it to invite your bot into your server

    <br>
    <br>
</div>
- Run the command `/henlo` of the bot and it will reply with `busted xD`. Done! Now `Ctrl C`


### 2. Something you should know:
- Allow at least 24 hours for your app's activity status to be updated. if u still uneligible, make sure that your bot have a slash command icon or because your bot is new even brand new and it take more than 24h to be fully registered as "active" on discord 
- You must enable the ***Community feature*** and you need ***Admin permission*** and you will see that in the server to appear in the server selection menu.
- Dont forget to turn on the `"Use data to improve Discord"` in User `Settings -> Privacy`
