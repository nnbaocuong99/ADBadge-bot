<h1 align="center"> ✨ 1 time use-bot to get the Active Devloper Badge ✨ </h1>

###### <ins>**this is the new version. The old code no longer works**</ins>

### 1. Summary
- Discord has launched a brand-new badge called [Active Developer Badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
- Used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges before, so I decided to share it. I really don't mind because this is super easy to make and everybody can make basic bot and get the badge, so just take it if you wanna.

###### Step 3
- Use your `IDE` or `Terminal` then run this command in the directory to install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install | npm i
```
- When the dependencies succesfully installed, replace the `your-bot-token` with your bot token and run this command:
> ***Warning*** 
> - If it not working, try `npm run run`
> - `Ctrl + C` to stop your bot
```yaml
npm run your-bot-token
```
- When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL. Use it to invite the bot to your server

### 3. Something you should know:

- You must enable the ***Community feature*** and you need ***Admin permission*** and you will see that in the server to appear in the server selection menu.
- Dont forget to turn on the `"Use data to improve Discord"` in User `Settings -> Privacy`
