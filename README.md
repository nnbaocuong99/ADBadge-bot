> <ins>**this is the new version. I've deleted the old one because the old code no longer works**</ins>


## ✨As you know / Summary
- Discord has launched a brand-new badge called [Active Developer Badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
- Used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges before, so i decided to share it. i really dont mind because this is super easy to make and everybody can make basic bot and get the badge, so just take it if you wanna. i dont have any license or tried to claim or steal from anyone.

> *you can turn off the bot by close your current IDE or `Ctrl + C` or enable the `process.exit` and the bot will automatically shutdown itself





- if ur bot successfully started and got an `online` status, invite it using the URL created on the Dev portal site.
- use the `/hithere` command by type `/` on the chat and select you bot
- if u still uneligible, that is because ur bot is new even brand new and it take abt 24h for ur bot to be fully registered as "active" on discord 
- dont forget to turn on the `"Use data to improve Discord"` in User `settings -> privacy` because at least one person using ur bot need that turned on in order for us to track command events.
